# hosted-podman-runtime.bats — every hosted job that runs a container must
# repair podman's OCI runtime first.
#
# Runner image ubuntu24/20260726.254 bumped podman 4.9.3 -> 5.8.4 but left
# /usr/bin/crun at 1.14.1, which podman 5 rejects ("crun: unknown version
# specified"). .github/actions/podman-runtime installs a compatible crun, but it
# only helps the jobs that USE it — and wiring it into "the workflow that was
# failing" left three others latently broken, each passing only while it happened
# to draw a podman-4 runner:
#
#   - ci-tests.yml gui-shots   (found by CI, red on a podman-5 draw)
#   - ci.yml build-deployer    (podman build, never repaired)
#   - e2e-snapshot.yml prime   (runs the full E2E)
#
# The pool is mixed, so a missing wire-up does not fail reliably — it fails
# later, on someone else's PR, looking like a broken package list. This test is
# the systematic sweep that the piecemeal fixes kept missing.
