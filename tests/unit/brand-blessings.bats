# Upstream blessings (#227) — the release matrix follows the recorded decision.
#
# Every branded exe wears somebody else's mark. `app/branding/*/blessing.json`
# records what that project said, and packaging/brands.sh is what makes the
# record load-bearing rather than documentary: a declined project's exe drops
# out of the release, and a brand nobody has written a record for cannot be
# built at all.
#
# The Go side (app/blessing_test.go) validates the records themselves — that a
# status agrees with its own four answers, and that a foreign mark cannot be
# marked blessed without a link to the yes. These tests cover the shell gate
# and the artifacts offered to the projects.
